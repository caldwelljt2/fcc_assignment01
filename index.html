        "I wish that [plight of Indians] was the only blot in our moral history, and that no other race had higher charges
        to bring against us. I am not apt to despair; yet I see not how we are to disengage ourselves from that
        deplorable entanglement, we have the wolf by the ears and feel the danger of either holding or letting him
        loose. I shall not live to see it but those who come after us will be wiser than we are, for light is spreading and
        man improving. to that advancement I look, and to the dispensations of an all-wise and all-powerful providence
        to devise the means of effecting what is right.""</p>

      <p>--  Thomas Jefferson to Lydia Sigourney, 1824 July 18</p>
